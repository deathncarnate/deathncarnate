I'm not about to bother with this so

You can sit next to me or something ingame I won't instantly kill you I'm surprisingly c+h friendly to some degree.
(I say to some degree because if you just stay awkward and quiet I'm gonna get up and leave lmao fuck you)
And if it seems like I am offtab you can whisper. But I'm mostly actually there and wouldn't mind if you interacted

also for status shit

🟢 - yeah I'm definitely there and you can bother me

🌙 - offtab like usual most likely but I'll prob see the whispers

⛔️ - Don't talk to me unless I talk to you. Likely busy with a friend when I have this on

💬 - if I use lf chat someone must've replaced my ass that can't be me
